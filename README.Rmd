## Overview

{flicker} is a collection of useful wrapper functions and extensions to the {dplyr} API which also work with Spark.

## Installation

You can install:

* the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/nathaneastwood/flicker) with

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathaneastwood/flicker")
```

* the latest release from CRAN with

```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("flicker")
```

## Usage

### Grouped Operations

These functions offer the benefit over the scoped variants of being able to explicitly specify the parameters for each expression to evaluate.

```{r grouped}
library(flicker)
mtcars %>%
  summarise_groups(
    .groups = c("am", "cyl"),
    avgMpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),
    avgDisp = mean(disp, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Scoped Variant "when"

These functions are subtly different from the scoped `_if()` variants of {dplyr} functions in that they can evaluate any predicate. They are useful when used within a chain of commands.

```{r when}
mtcars %>% filter_when("cyl" %in% colnames(mtcars) ~ cyl == 4)
```

### Union Select

This function will union the records from multiple data sets returning only the requested columns.

```{r union_select}
a <- data.frame(col1 = 1:5, col2 = 6, col3 = rnorm(5))
b <- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, col2 = 4, col3 = rnorm(3))
c <- data.frame(col1 = c(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), col3 = rnorm(7))

union_select(.data = list(a, b, c), c("col1", "col3"))
```

### Cross Joins

As of {dplyr} 1.0.0, cross joins have been available through the use of `full_join(by = character())` but this is not a natural way to perform the operation in my opinion.

```{r cross_join}
x <- data.frame(id = 1:2, val = rnorm(2))
y <- data.frame(run = 1:2, res = rnorm(2))
cross_join(x, y)
```
